# MBARI_ArgoBfile_generation
MATLAB code used to generate Argo B-file NetCDFs.  This code was originally written by Annie Wong (apsw.uw@gmail.com).  It was adapted (and is currently maintained) by Tanya Maurer (tmaurer@mbari.org) for use in the MBARI BGC-Argo near real-time float processing system.  Argo Bfiles are generated daily for all floats processed by MBARI; Bfiles are pushed to AOML for submission to the Argo GDACs.  Please direct any code-related questions to Annie Wong and/or Tanya Maurer.
